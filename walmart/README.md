The process consisted of three technical rounds followed by one hiring manager discussion. Here's a breakdown of each stage:

**Round 1: SQL & Spark Practical**

- **Duration:** 60 minutes
- **Details:** This was a hands-on coding round focusing on SQL and Apache Spark.
  - First 15 minutes: The interviewer asked about my current project and past experience.
  - Next 45 minutes: Pure coding! SQL problems involving:
    - RANK(), LEAD(), LAG()
    - Complex JOIN queries
    - Writing equivalent solutions using Spark APIs
- **Pro Tip:** Be well-versed in window functions and performance optimizations in Spark SQL—they often come up in interviews.
- **Outcome:** I solved all problems successfully and moved to the next round!

**Round 2: Spark, Kafka & GCP Concepts**

- **Duration:** 60 minutes
- **Details:** This round was more conceptual, covering:
  - Spark Optimizations: Partitioning, caching, shuffle operations
  - Kafka Fundamentals: Architecture, message retention, producer-consumer mechanics
  - Google Cloud Platform (GCP): If you have prior experience, expect questions on:
    - BigQuery
    - Dataflow
    - Pub/Sub
- **Pro Tip:** If you're not familiar with GCP, focus on Spark and Kafka. AWS or Azure knowledge can also be useful in similar roles.
- **Outcome:** Cleared this round with a solid discussion on Kafka and Spark optimizations.

**Round 3: System Design + Scala + Architecture**

- **Duration:** 75 minutes
- **Details:** This was the most comprehensive round, covering:
  - System Design: Designing a high-scale data pipeline
  - Scala Coding: Practical problems, output predictions
  - Project Deep Dive: In-depth questions about my past projects
  - Lambda & Kappa Architectures: Key differences, real-world use cases
  - Spark Deep Dive:
    - Caching strategies
    - Executor tuning
    - Spark Streaming & Kafka integration
- **Pro Tip:** Revise system design principles for data-intensive applications and be comfortable explaining your project decisions in detail.
- **Outcome:** Passed! Time for the final discussion.

**Round 4: Hiring Manager Discussion**

- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Details:** This was a behavioral round focusing on:
  - Team collaboration and handling conflicts
  - Problem-solving approach
  - Experience with large-scale data systems
- **Pro Tip:** Prepare STAR-method responses for common behavioral questions.
- **Outcome:** Positive feedback and a move to the offer stage!

**Final Steps: Offer Negotiation**

Walmart's negotiation flexibility is limited, so be prepared for that. The offer process typically takes 1–2 weeks post-final interview.

**Key Takeaways for Future Candidates**

- SQL is king—Focus on window functions, joins, and optimizations.
- Know Spark inside-out—Performance tuning, caching, and architecture questions are common.
- Kafka fundamentals—Be clear on message flow and real-time data processing.
- System design matters—Expect high-level discussions on data pipelines and architectures.
- Behavioral questions count—Have structured answers for teamwork and problem-solving scenarios.
